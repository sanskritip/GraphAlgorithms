# GraphAlgorithms

Implementation of the following algorithms:

- Welsh Powell for Graph Coloring
- Boruvkas Algorithm to find Minimum spanning Tree
- Reverse Delete Algorithm to find Miniumum spanning Tree
- Tarjans Algorithm to find Articulation point/ Cut Vertices of a Graph
- Finding Maximal Matching in a Bipartite Graph
- Chinese Postman Problem solved using Fleury's Algorithm and Dijkstra's Algorithm
